## Yo

I have the need. The need for speed.
Which is why you see me constantly making tweaks to my [nvim config](https://github.com/phishbacon/nvim). Currently interested in web development with SvelteKit and dabbling in Linux kernel module development.

I am the creator of the insanely popular [seti-black](https://github.com/phishbacon/seti-black) theme for vscode ðŸ¤¢. I know... I'm sorry.

#### Currently working on
* [Lyric Sync](https://github.com/phishbacon/lyric-sync) (Sync lyrics to your Plex music Library)
* [shadcn-svelte.nvim](https://github.com/phishbacon/shadcn-svelte.nvim) (Quickly install shadcn-svelte components in neovim)
